# Team revolTOS

We are Federico, Paulo, Carlos, Eduardo and Rita, and we can basically can fix from a radio to a CT scanner, we can design circuits with logic gates, with PICs, with microprocessors and even micro-controllers. We used to mention the languages we know how to code with... Lately it's easier to say that Ruby on rails and Python are not our thing, but we can even code in ancient mayan!

Besides that, with Eduardo we complement our coding skills with artistic design, which makes our creation a real piece of art. Carlos provides the business insights to make revolTOS an always market-oriented/market-driven group. Paulo and Rita design our products in such a way that the user experience goes as a charm. And Federico builds the backend to make sure our products are meaningful.

Since an early age I have been fascinated by the idea of creating economic value through disruptive
technologies and by the impact of such projects in society. I work on technology transfer projects, product
identification, market analysis, finding strategies to market entry and financial analysis. I dream about the
day where the interface between Research / Business / Finance disappears, contributing this way to
global development.

I think of myself as a “data-driven person”, somebody who likes to dig deeply into collected information
and then look for the facts in order to make decisions based on them. Also, since the early stages of my
career I have had a self-driven, self-motivated way of encompassing work in multidisciplinary
environments, sometimes having limited or no supervision at all, and still achieving or surpassing the
expected goals.

I think of myself as an engineering artist. I understand how people interact with problems, interfaces and
situations, and creatively define structures to facilitate those interactions. I have multidisciplinary
experience in design and product development to successfully guide the product to market.


<h2>Eduardo Nunes</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/eduardonunes.png"/>

I am a cross-media designer, a student, a teacher, a researcher and I am absolutely passionate about digital beauty. I love web design and reflecting the way I see the world, a problem and its solution in the simplest and most possibly touching way. I have experience in many types of coding, which provides me with the tools to execute a project from the conception, to the design, to the development.


<h2>Rita</h2> <img src="http://privacypal.fcismondi.koding.io/img/ritaoliveira.png"/>

I am an engineer till my last fiber. I like looking at situations and tasks, evaluate the way they are done, and improve the interaction with them. I am passionate about coding and user experience, and I focus my work in making people's life easier. Human-machine interfaces should be simple and intuitive, and I wake up everyday aiming at that!
